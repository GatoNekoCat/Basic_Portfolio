                A way out west there was a fella, 
                fella I want to tell you about, fella 
                by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At 
                least, that was the handle his lovin' 
                parents gave him, but he never had 
                much use for it himself. This 
                Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. 
                Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
                self-apply where I come from. But 
                then, there was a lot about the Dude 
                that didn't make a whole lot of sense 
                to me. And a lot about where he 
                lived, like- wise. But then again, 
                maybe that's why I found the place 
                s'durned innarestin'... -the stranger
